# Acquia CLI

The official command-line tool for interacting with the Acquia Cloud Platform and services. Acquia CLI (acli) helps you run [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) commands and tail logs from your Acquia-hosted applications, manage [Acquia Cloud IDEs](https://docs.acquia.com/dev-studio/ide/), create and manage teams and applications via the [Cloud Platform API](https://cloudapi-docs.acquia.com/), and much more!

Acquia CLI is not a local development environment. If you are looking for an integrated development environment, consider [Acquia Cloud IDE](https://docs.acquia.com/dev-studio/ide/) or third-party tools such as [Lando](https://lando.dev/).
